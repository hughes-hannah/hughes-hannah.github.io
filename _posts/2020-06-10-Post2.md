[Evo Morales Twitter History](http://hughes-hannah.github.io/Evo%20Morales%20-%20Twitter%20History.xlsx)

[#BoliviaProtests](http://hughes-hannah.github.io/BoliviaProtests.xlsx)

For Evo Morales, it is interesting to note the large spike in average retweets and likes in November 2019, which corresponds to the disputed election in late October, the protests that spread across Bolivia, and his ultimate resignation in mid-November.
