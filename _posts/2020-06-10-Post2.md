title: Homework 1 - Twitter Data
---

Using GetOldTweets and Python, I analyzed the most recent posts (up to 1,000) for the following:

#### **Usernames**
1. sebastianpinera
  *-- Personal page for Sebastian Pinera, President of Chile*

2. presidencia_cl
*-- Official page for the President of Chile*

3. evoespueblo
*-- Personal page for Evo Morales, Former President of Bolivia*

#### **Tags**

1. #ChileProtests

2. #BoliviaProtests

# Output
I have attached the output for #BoliviaProtests and Evo Morales.  For Evo Morales, it is interesting to note the large spike in average retweets and likes in November 2019, which corresponds to the disputed election in late October, the protests that spread across Bolivia, and his ultimate resignation in mid-November.
