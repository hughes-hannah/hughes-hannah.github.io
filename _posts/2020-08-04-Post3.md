title: Project - Chile Protests

## 2019-20 Chile Protests

### What Happened: 
- Subway fare increase in Santiago in October 2019 led to the largest protests in Chilean history,  with over 1 million people protesting in the streets of Santiago
  - Protests quickly spread across the country
- No clear leader or cause
- Key focus areas seem to be high levels of income inequality and the cost of services, such as healthcare and education, that were privatized during the Pinochet dictatorship

### Key Questions: 
- Chile is often called Latin America's Poster Child due to its neoliberal economic model, rapid economic growth, relative government stability, and low levels of absolute poverty
- So why did mass protests break out across the country over a small rise in the cost of a metro ticket in Santiago?
- Could data have been used to "predict" or anticipate this crisis?
- Is this a "revolution of rising expectations"?  

### Methods:
For this project, I simply wanted to explore the available data using new tools and techniques learned in this class, including Git, Python, and R.

#### Part A: Visualization of Macro Data
###### Goal: 
Exploratory data analysis to
  1. Determine if there are any expected or unexpected relationships between the variables that should be explored further, and
  2. Develop time series model to analyze the relationship (if any) between copper prices and protest activity

###### Data Collection: 
Data was collected using APIs and corresponding R packages, when available.  The following chart summarizes the data collected for this project, including the source and API or non-API method.  R code for accessing the APIs is below.

|    Data     |    Source   |     Database    |     API    |R package      |     R name    |

| General Government Deficit, Total (% of GDP)     | OECD |National Accounts at a Glance      |Yes      |OECD        |deficit|
| Twitter Data     | Twitter |N/A      |Yes      |rtweet        |N/A|

###### Methods: 
The R packages tidyverse/dpylr were used extensively to select, filter, and mutate variables, and join the various datasets into a single data frame for analysis.  This process was more challenging than expected, and more work should be done to further visualize the data.  R script for data cleaning and transformation is below.



The R packages ggplot2 and patchwork were used for data visualization.  Below each image is the corresponding R script.

#### Part B: Twitter Data Analysis
###### Goal: 
Explore Twitter data from 3 key time periods: 2019 pre-protest, late October 2019 at the height of the protests, and now to see how the key topics and sentiment has changed over time.

###### Data Selection: 
Because geographic data is limited by Twitter's privacy policies, I chose to evaluate mentions: @sebastianpinera, which is the personal Twitter account of Chile's President Sebastian Pinera.  Based on a quick review of Twitter, there are more posts from the @sebastianpinera account vs. the official @presidente_cl account.  Thus, I felt the responses to @sebastianpinera would be more robust.

###### Data Collection:
Data was collected using both the API and non-API method. The non-API method, the python package GetOldTweets3, was used to source historical tweets, as Twitter's official API only allows you to scrape tweets from the last 7 days.  For tweets within the last week, the R package rtweet was used.  While GetOldTweets can be ran in the command prompt, I had issues when exporting the csv files; instead, I used the python shell to download the twitter data in a data frame, which I then exported to csv/excel.  The python and R codes are below.

###### Methods: 
The historical twitter data was loaded in R, and the packages ggplot2, wordcloud, igraph, XXX, XXX, and XXX were used to analyze and visualize the data.  Below each image is the R script used for the visualization and any key observations.

### Future research: 
Potential dissertation topic; plan to explore the topic further.
